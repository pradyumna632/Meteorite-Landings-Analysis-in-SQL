# Meteorite-Landings-Analysis-in-SQL

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze NASA's meteorite dataset using SQL. Meteorites are fascinating objects from space that have landed on Earth. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into various aspects of meteorite landings, such as their locations, sizes, and classifications. This repository contains the SQL scripts and documentation necessary to perform this analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is NASA's meteorite landings dataset, which is publicly available on their website. The dataset contains information about meteorites that have been observed or collected on Earth. It includes details such as the name, location, mass, and classification of each meteorite.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to explore and analyze the meteorite landings dataset using SQL. The analysis includes extracting valuable information and insights by running SQL queries on the dataset. Some of the key aspects to be analyzed include:

### Meteorite Classification: Understanding the distribution of meteorite classifications (e.g., iron, stony, etc.).
### Meteorite Landings by Location: Analyzing the geographic distribution of meteorite landings.
### Meteorite Mass: Examining the mass distribution of meteorites.
### Meteorite Impacts Over Time: Investigating trends in meteorite impacts over the years.
